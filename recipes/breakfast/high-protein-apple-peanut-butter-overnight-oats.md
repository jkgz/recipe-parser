## Ingredients

- 2 small Honeycrisp apples (about 6 ounces each), divided
- 2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats
- 2 cups unsweetened soy milk
- ¾ cup nonfat plain strained (Greek-style) yogurt
- 4 tablespoons smooth natural peanut butter, divided
- 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- ⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Chop 1 apple into bite-size pieces.

2. Combine 2 cups oats, 2 cups soy milk, ¾ cup yogurt, 3 tablespoons peanut butter, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 1 tablespoon vanilla, ¼ teaspoon salt and ⅛ teaspoon cinnamon in a medium bowl; whisk well. Stir in the chopped apple. Cover and refrigerate until thickened, at least 8 hours.

3. When ready to serve, transfer the oats into 4 (8-oz.) jars. Top evenly with the remaining 1 tablespoon peanut butter (about ¾ teaspoon each). Finely chop half of the remaining apple and top each jar with about 3 tablespoons each. (Reserve the remaining apple half for another use.)
