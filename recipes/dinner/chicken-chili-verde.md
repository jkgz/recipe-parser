## Ingredients

- 2 (15 ounce) cans no-salt-added pinto beans, rinsed, divided
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1.5 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces
- 2 cups chopped yellow onion (1 medium)
- 2 cups chopped poblano peppers (2 large)
- 5 cloves garlic, chopped (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)
- 4 cups unsalted chicken stock
- 1.5 cups prepared salsa verde
- 0.5 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups frozen corn kernels (about 12 ounces)
- 2 cups chopped spinach (about 2 ounces)
- 1.5 cups coarsely chopped fresh cilantro
- 6 tablespoons sour cream

## Instructions

1. Mash 1 cup beans in a small bowl with a whisk or potato masher.

2. Heat oil in a large heavy pot over high heat. Add chicken; cook until browned, turning occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes. Add onion, poblanos and garlic. Cook until the onion is translucent and tender, 4 to 5 minutes.

3. Add the remaining whole beans, the mashed beans, stock, salsa and salt. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Stir in corn, spinach and cilantro. Cook until the spinach is wilted, about 1 minute. Serve topped with sour cream.
